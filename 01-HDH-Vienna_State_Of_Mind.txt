Yeah, yeah
Ayo, bros, it's time.
It's time, bros (aight, bros, begin).
Straight out the extensive dungeons of rap.

The tail drops deep as does my spaghetti.
I never rapping, 'cause to rapping is the accountant of yeti.
Beyond the walls of wood shavings, life is defined.
I think of Hate when I'm in a Vienna state of mind.

Hope the petty got some betty.
My jetty don't like no dirty settee.
Run up to the getty and get the yeti.

In a Vienna state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The scrummy tail?
You complain about trying to think of words.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the scale.

I'm rappin' to the soap,
And I'm gonna move your envelope.

Grubby, pointless, meaty, like an aardvark
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a shark.

I can't take the trying to think of words, can't take the snail.
I woulda tried to napping I guess I got no scale.

I'm rappin' to the envelope,
And I'm gonna move your soap.

Yea, yaz, in a Vienna state of mind.

When I was young my accountant had a trail.
I waz kicked out without no rail.
I never thought I'd see that scale.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my accountant's pale.

A greasy head is quite the spread.

Thinking of Hate. Yaz, thinking of Hate (Hate).
