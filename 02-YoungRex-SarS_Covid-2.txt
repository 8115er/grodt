Chorus:
Working from home were in quarantine
jumping around it feels like a dream
didnt go outside for round half a year
feeling secluded, but still got my beer

Verse 1:
Feels like eternity haven't been outside
the numbers are climbing pa pa (shooting sound)
but see the bright side
soon we'll be back and partyin', like its our last time

Chorus:
Working from home were in quarantine
jumping around it feels like a dream
didnt go outside for round half a year
feeling secluded, but still got my beer

Verse 2:
Waiting for 2 years to finally get an rtx
all the new games, are far too complex
i only want to play cyberpunk without these lags
hoping i can get one without the price being 4x

Chorus:
Working from home were in quarantine
jumping around it feels like a dream
didnt go outside for round half a year
feeling secluded, but still got my beer

Chorus:
Working from home were in quarantine
jumping around it feels like a dream
didnt go outside for round half a year
feeling secluded, but still got my beer
