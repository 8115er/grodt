Yeah, yeah
Ayo, developer, it's time.
It's time, developer (aight, developer, begin).
Straight out the complicated dungeons of rap.

The master drops deep as does my commits.
I never push, 'cause to push is the buddy of bits.
Beyond the walls of commits, life is defined.
I think of init when I'm in a GitHub state of mind.

Hope the bits got some spitz.
My glitz don't like no dirty wits.
Run up to the blitz and get the ritz.

In a GitHub state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The fit master?
You complain about commands not working.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the alabaster.

I'm rappin' to the request,
And I'm gonna move your quest.

Futuristic, stunning, lifeless, like a branch
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a ranch.

I can't take the commands not working, can't take the pull.
I woulda tried to commit I guess I got no irish bull.

I'm rappin' to the quest,
And I'm gonna move your request.

Yea, yaz, in a GitHub state of mind.

When I was young my buddy had an aster.
I waz kicked out without no plaster.
I never thought I'd see that disaster.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my buddy's alabaster.

A stupid origin is quite the origen.

Thinking of init. Yaz, thinking of init (init).
