# Git Init #
## a rap song written by HDH ###
<br>

>Yeah, yeah
<br>
Ayo, developer, it's time.
<br>
It's time, developer (aight, developer, begin).
<br>
Straight out the complicated dungeons of rap.

>The master drops deep as does my commits.
<br>
I never push, 'cause to push is the buddy of bits.
<br>
Beyond the walls of commits, life is defined.
<br>
I think of init when I'm in a GitHub state of mind.

>Hope the bits got some spitz.
<br>
My glitz don't like no dirty wits.
<br>
Run up to the blitz and get the ritz.

>In a GitHub state of mind.
<br>
What more could you ask for? The fit master?
<br>
You complain about commands not working.
<br>
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the alabaster.

>I'm rappin' to the request,
<br>
And I'm gonna move your quest.

>Futuristic, stunning, lifeless, like a branch
<br>
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a ranch.

>I can't take the commands not working, can't take the pull.
<br>
I woulda tried to commit I guess I got no irish bull.

>I'm rappin' to the quest,
<br>
And I'm gonna move your request.

>Yea, yaz, in a GitHub state of mind.

>When I was young my buddy had an aster.
<br>
I waz kicked out without no plaster.
<br>
I never thought I'd see that disaster.
<br>
Ain't a soul alive that could take my buddy's alabaster.

>A stupid origin is quite the origen.

>Thinking of init. Yaz, thinking of init (init).
