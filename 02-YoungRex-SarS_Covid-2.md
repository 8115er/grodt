###Chorus:
>Working from home were in quarantine
<br>
jumping around it feels like a dream
<br>
didnt go outside for round half a year
<br>
feeling secluded, but still got my beer

###Verse 1:
>Feels like eternity haven't been outside
<br>
the numbers are climbing pa pa (shooting sound)
<br>
but see the bright side
<br>
soon we'll be back and partyin', like its our last time
<br>

###Chorus:
>Working from home were in quarantine
<br>
jumping around it feels like a dream
<br>
didnt go outside for round half a year
<br>
feeling secluded, but still got my beer

###Verse 2:
>Waiting for 2 years to finally get an rtx
<br>
all the new games, are far too complex
<br>
i only want to play cyberpunk without these lags
<br>
hoping i can get one without the price being 4x

###Chorus:
>Working from home were in quarantine
<br>
jumping around it feels like a dream
<br>
didnt go outside for round half a year
<br>
feeling secluded, but still got my beer
