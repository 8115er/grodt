<br>

> Yeah, yeah
<br>
Ayo, bros, it's time.
<br>
It's time, bros (aight, bros, begin).
<br>
Straight out the extensive dungeons of rap.

>The tail drops deep as does my spaghetti.
<br>
I never rapping, 'cause to rapping is the accountant of yeti.
<br>
Beyond the walls of wood shavings, life is defined.
<br>
I think of Hate when I'm in a Vienna state of mind.

>Hope the petty got some betty.
<br>
My jetty don't like no dirty settee.
<br>
Run up to the getty and get the yeti.

>In a Vienna state of mind.
<br>
What more could you ask for? The scrummy tail?
<br>
You complain about trying to think of words.
<br>
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the scale.

>I'm rappin' to the soap,
<br>
And I'm gonna move your envelope.

>Grubby, pointless, meaty, like an aardvark
<br>
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a shark.

>I can't take the trying to think of words, can't take the snail.
<br>
I woulda tried to napping I guess I got no scale.

>I'm rappin' to the envelope,
<br>
And I'm gonna move your soap.

>Yea, yaz, in a Vienna state of mind.

>When I was young my accountant had a trail.
<br>
I waz kicked out without no rail.
<br>
I never thought I'd see that scale.
<br>
Ain't a soul alive that could take my accountant's pale.

>A greasy head is quite the spread.

>Thinking of Hate. Yaz, thinking of Hate (Hate).
