Loving git Rap song:


Chorus:
working with the help of git
sitting at home, and tryin' to commit
when i push all my homies see it
lovin' the vcs i guarantee it

Verse 1:
sometimes when im using git
it feels like i got kicked
because i just cant push, but shush
i can just use google, gonna get brutal
when i just force my commit up on git

Chorus:
working with the help of git
sitting at home, and tryin' to commit
when i push all my homies see it
lovin' the vcs i guarantee it

Verse 2:
Git rich or die trying
thats what everyones denying
but I know theres no defying
because nobodie's undying

Chorus:
working with the help of git
sitting at home, and tryin' to commit
when i push all my homies see it
lovin' the vcs i guarantee it

Chorus:
working with the help of git
sitting at home, and tryin' to commit
when i push all my homies see it
lovin' the vcs i guarantee it
